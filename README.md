 ### Hi There 👋
 
 I'm Levis from Kenya, and I'm a Web 3  Data Analyst. I really enjoy learning languages like Typescript and GraphQl and frameworks like React and Next.js, as well as work in SQL. I also enjoy building subgraphs that index blockchain data directly from node providers. You can check out my twitter at [scoffie](https://twitter.com/iithundio).
